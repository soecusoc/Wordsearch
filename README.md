# Wordsearch
Find the most common words in a .txt file

Compile the code with some appropriate c-compiler.
Name it "wordsearch.exe".
Usage: wordsearch.exe <yourfile.txt>
Notice: .txt file must be in the same directory as the .exe file.

This was my coursework in university.

Wordsearch is a program that finds the 100 most common words in
a .txt file and lists them from the most common to the less common.
Able to handle quite large .txt files: tested with a file with about
1 million words in total. It may crash with very long words.
Supports English alphabet.
